# OperatingPyEnvironment
This is a customizable operative environment written in Python, you can add commands using the API(in the file `oapi.py`) 
as showed in the file `basepl.py`.

For launching the program, run `operative_environment.py`.

## Important
This project is incomplete, I'll release the API documentation and more detailed tutorials when I'll finish the project.
